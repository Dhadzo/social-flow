I want you to generate a frontend React app for a multi-platform social media posting tool. The app should let users connect social media accounts, create posts with text and media, select platforms, schedule posts, and view post history.

Requirements:

Use React and functional components.

Use TailwindCSS for styling.

Use React Router for navigation between pages.

Use React Query for data fetching, caching, and state management of posts and connected accounts.

Include the following pages/components:

Login / Signup page

Email/password login form

OAuth login buttons (Google, GitHub)

Dashboard

Overview of connected social media accounts

Button to create a new post

List of recent posts with status (Posted / Scheduled / Failed)

Use React Query to fetch mock posts and accounts

Post Composer Page

Textarea for post content

Media uploader (images/video) preview

Platform selection checkboxes (Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram, TikTok)

Schedule post date/time picker

Submit button to post now or schedule

Update React Query cache after posting

Post History Page

Table/list of past posts

Status of each post (success/failure)

Platform icons showing where the post was published

Settings Page

Connect / disconnect social media accounts

User profile info

Functionality:

Form validation for post content and media type

Responsive design for desktop and mobile

Modular component structure (Button, Input, Card, PostItem, MediaPreview)

Use mock data for connected accounts and posts (no backend integration yet)

Use React Query for all async data operations and caching

Optional: use React Context for global UI state (like modals or notifications)

Deliverables:

A fully functional React app with Tailwind styling

Clearly separated components in /components folder

Routing in /pages folder

Sample mock posts and accounts data to render lists and previews

Nice modern UI design with cards, buttons, and forms

React Query setup with mock API calls for posts and accounts
